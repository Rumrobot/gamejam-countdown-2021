# GameJam 2021 Countdown project
## What is this?
First of all, I would like to explain what GameJam is. GameJam is a yearly event hosted by Coding Pirates in Denmark.
It's a lot like other GameJams - you meetup and have 24 hours to code and submit a game that you and / or your team created.

This is a project consists of a few different parts. 

# # # ```Node.js```
The ```Node.js``` part of this project is responsible of rendering a website that people can interact with. It will consist of a login system, a simple admin system to verify accounts and a system that people can interact with.
